# AlphaChatBot
GPT3-based AI chatbot

Hi!

Welcome to the Alpha ChatBot repoisitory. This chatbot is a GPT3-bsed chatbot with some extras :)

Alpha is fully capable of answering 98% of your questions, although it can be a bit weird and funny at times (ask it what it is you'll be surprised!)
it is a fun chatbot to talk to, but you'll need to install some dependencies in your virtual environment to make it work.



**NOTICE**

**IN ORDER FOR ALPHA TO RUN CORRECTLY YOU NEED AN OPENAI API ACCESS KEY**

**YOU CAN GET ONE FOR FREE ON OPENAI'S WEBSITE BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT AND CREATING AN ACCESS KEY**



**Step 1: Setting up your virtual environment**

I find using VS Code works best for me when creating projects like Alpha, but any IDE should be fine. 

Open a terminal and create a python file of your choice of name.

Then create a virtual environment with the command "python -m venv myenv" (for MacOS/Linux/Windows)

If "python" doesn't work, try "python3".

Note: you can name your virtual environment anything you'd like, just change the "myenv" part of the command.

Next, activate your virtual environment with the command: "source myenv/bin/activate" (MacOS/Linux) or "myenv\Scripts\activate" (Windows).

When you're done with your virtual environment just type the command "deactivate" (MacOS/Linux/Windows).

**Step 2: OpenAI library: Install the OpenAI Python library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:**

"pip install openai"  (All systems)

Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations, so you should already have it if you have Python installed.

**Step 3: Copy and paste code**

Once OpenAI is downloaded and you have your access key, go to the code and change the code on line 7 ("your-api-key") 
and input your api key.

**Step 4: Run Alpha ChatBot**

Run the Python script by executing the following command: "python name-of-file.py" 
For some users you might have to type "python3" instead of "python".


Congrats! You can now talk with Alpha! 
Be sure to check back every couple of days as Alpha's code will be constantly changing for better use and more experience!
